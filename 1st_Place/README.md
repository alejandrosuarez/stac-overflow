## About the solution

Initially, I understood that I would not be able to build a super complex neural network, because either there was not enough knowledge or there was not enough computing power.

Therefore, the only chance to win was to come up with a simpler method for determining flooding. To do this, I studied articles about how waterlogging is determined now. There were neural network methods, but there were also mathematical methods. From which I concluded that in addition to segmentation by a neural network, you can try to determine the flooding pixel by pixel by some formula.

But since I am a "cool" data scientist ü¶ß, I did not output the formula manually, but trained ML models ‚Äì Catboostclassifier, which solved the binary classification problem on pixel-by-pixel data.

Before that, I also trained the Unet models.

Further, I noticed that the models often do not fill the necessary zones, rather than overfill. Therefore, I combined the predictions of these two approaches, taking their maxima, not the average.

And as you can see, this approach worked and brought me such an important victory! ü•≥

You can see other notes about the solution in the jupyter-notebooks.
